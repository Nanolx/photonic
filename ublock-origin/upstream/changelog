|  
| The user interface of the *"3rd-party filters"* has been revisited:

-  To render better in devices with smaller screen.
-  Clicking *"Update now"* is no longer a blocking operation.
-  The home icon is a link to the support site for a given filter list.
-  The clock icon replaces the *"purge cache"* label.

   -  Click to mark a filter list as out-of-date.

-  The custom filter lists input field has been repurposed to *import* external
   filter lists, as opposed to *declare* external filter lists as was the case
   before.

   -  An imported filter list will have an "X" icon aside its name, to be used
      to remove the custom filter list.

-  You can now hide unused filter lists by clicking the global filter count at
   the top.

| 
| Procedural cosmetic filters can now be chained and recursive (`something
  which was
  planned <https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/fb6ad8c232e06ab715cbd6f16e94f5c7afa6cb89c109540e1e0a37171db883eb/https%3A//github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/1930%23issuecomment-242053806>`__)
  .
|  
| New procedural cosmetic filter operators:

-  ``:has-text(argument)``: to filter elements according to whether they have a
   specific text string found in them. Use ``/.../`` to match a literal regular
   expression instead of plain text.
-  ``:if()``/``:if-not(argument)``: use to implement recursion, ``argument`` is
   itself a valid procedural cosmetic filter, but can also be a plain CSS
   selector.

| 
| The cost of parsing procedural cosmetic filters has been moved from content
  script-time to filter list compile-time, i.e. done only once when a filter
  list is updated.
|  
| `Documentation about procedural cosmetic
  filters <https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/e0d0195070a22ac2a597b5fe10311d52d2be99d6d9f6307e2f9ed6e5a8fe7069/https%3A//github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Procedural-cosmetic-filters>`__
  has been updated.
|  
| The element picker supports all procedural cosmetic filters, i.e. it will
  also provide visual feedback as you enter manually such filters in the input
  field. Invalid filters, procedural or not, will be labelled with a bright red
  "E".

   (issue filed for Edge, but also present on other platforms, those not
   supporting user styles or shadow DOM).

   -  The fix needs to be tested/confirmed for the Edge version.
   -  For Chromium-based browsers, use of shadow DOM has been removed in an
      attempt to simplify/unify generic implementation of the concept of user
      styles. (can be brought back if feedback shows it's needed).
   -  Most reliable and low overhead cosmetic filtering is on modern Firefox
      (38+), all other platforms (Chromium, Edge, legacy Firefox, Safari) not
      providing proper "user styles" API rely on same generic implementation.

| **Changes**
|  
| Implementation of cosmetic filter operator ``:matches-css`` has been revised
  according to the discussion at
  `https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/1930#issuecomment-241997548 <https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/e33d47c772e051558b95b081bee9c3d3af5b71a1b7fd4bf13e0d4ffd7a281d0d/https%3A//github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/1930%23issuecomment-241997548>`__

-  ``:matches-css`` now accept no more than one single style property. If more
   than one style property must be matched on the same node, you will need to
   chain them (i.e. ``div##matches-css(...):matches-css(...)`` -- ability to
   chain is coming for next release). Since there is only one style property,
   do not use trailing ``;``.
-  ``:matches-css-before()`` and ``:matches-css-after()`` are now also
   available to specifically match style property for the pseudo elements
   ``:before`` and ``:after`` on a node.
-  Support the use of regexes for property matching: if the first and last
   character of the value to match is ``/``, the value will be deemed to be a
   literal regular expression which must be matched.

|  
| **Changes**
|  
| **Dynamic filtering pane**
|  
| The dynamic filtering pane in the popup panel is now available in read-only
  mode to users who did not enable *"I am an advanced user"* in *Settings*.
|  
| The rationale for this change is explained in `issue
  2010 <https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/21124a961707af24939ecd0e403e859151fcf0f15751af6d373324df79bf5a16/https%3A//github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/2010>`__.
  It still is collapsed by default, but can be brought up by clicking the
  *"requests blocked"* or *"domains connected"* fields in the main area.
|  
| **Template-based scriptlets**
|  
| In order to promote the reuse of `injectable
  scriplets <https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/7a87d5f4a72188408f72b9372e0d80454f9a33cb3a8f84563ca679d1cca08696/https%3A//github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Static-filter-syntax%23scriptinject>`__
  across different sites, it is now possible for a scriptlet to accept
  arguments. The arguments are comma-separated and appear after the token (for
  example `a real
  case <https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/cf928b63556c74e09710a0efa2bd336fdc8bab3165d3a0479b7460b9121ae9f8/https%3A//github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/issues/184>`__).
|  
| In the example above, the scriplet ``abort-on-property-write.js`` contains a
  placeholder for one argument, which placeholder will be replaced with the
  argument ``_sp_``. Placeholders for scriplets which accept arguments will
  *always* be for string values (reminder that injectable scriplets are `part
  of the
  project <https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/572add35fa16e6130cd5e27a456d7b2b16336ff4d542bcc75964b0a6a98cf8b4/https%3A//github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/blob/master/filters/resources.txt>`__,
  never from an external party).
|  
| **Advanced settings**
|  
| A new `*"Advanced settings"*
  pane <https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/1b4a3c386425fdb9427acb1f9eacd7838e5dfcd0093be8c52e243bbd20cb5313/https%3A//github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Advanced-settings>`__,
  available only to advanced users. It contains settings which are
  experimental, or which are of interest to advanced users who want more
  control over how uBO behaves internally. I do not want to bloat the
  *Settings* pane in the dashboard with settings which are of interest only to
  a minority of users or which are experimental: this is where the new
  *"Advanced settings"* pane is useful.
|  
| When you enabled *"Advanced users"* in the *Settings* pane, a *cogs* icon
  will appear next to that setting. Click this *cogs* icon to access those
  "hidden" advanced settings.
|  
| The UI of the advanced settings page is purposefully stern. Keep in mind that
  whatever settings you see in there may be experimental and could be removed
  at any time in the future.
|  
| Experimental advanced setting of interest: ``suspendTabsUntilReady`` (default
  to ``false``), to prevent uBO from establishing any remote connection at
  launch before all filter lists/settings have been fully loaded (`related
  issue
  #1327 <https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/1a98fd0360addb169330a26894ea3646d8beddcd399804d9c79ef714270d94ea/https%3A//github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/1327>`__).
  How well it works will have to be evaluated by users.
|  
| **WebExtensions**
|  
| From now on, there will be a Firefox's WebExtension version of uBO (see
  ``uBlock0.webext.zip`` in `Release
  notes <https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/cd1034de09379f442b0dc55cfc879f166938a715dab96e3e61bcea9e013bf599/https%3A//github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases/tag/1.10.0>`__,
  see `*"Temporary Installation in

  on how to install on Firefox). Do not bother trying it out if you do not have
  Nightly 52.0a1 (2016-10-29) or later installed. Also, do not open issues for
  the WebExtension version of uBO -- it is still at an experimental stage and
  there are things which are known to be missing in the API for uBO to fully
  function: see `bugzilla

|  
| **Changes**
|  
| Some work has been done on the element picker:

-  can now handle procedural cosmetic filters (``:has``, ``matches-css``,
   ``:xpath``), and also the special operator ``:style`` -- matching elements
   of such filters will be highlighted like normal CSS selector-based filters.
-  an invalid filter in the input field will now trigger a visual cue: the
   background of the input field will be reddish.
-  the number of elements on the current page matching the filter in the input
   field is now displayed in the bottom right corner of the input field.
-  the preview mode is now sticky, i.e. you can modify the filter in the input
   field without being kicked out of preview mode. Convenient when creating
   ``:style``-based cosmetic filters.

| 
| The *Privacy* setting *"Disable hyperlink auditing/beacon"* has been changed
  to *"Disable hyperlink auditing"*, and network requests of type ``beacon``
  are no longer blanket-blocked. The network requests of type ``beacon`` will
  now be filtered just like any other network requests, according to the
  current filters/rules.
|  
| Network requests of type ``csp_report`` will be blocked regardless of
  filters/rules when there is a probability they are fired as a result of uBO
  internally redirecting one or more network requests to neutered resources. In
  such case, uBO considers these ``csp_report`` network requests as "spurious"
  and blocks them. An example of such spurious CSP reports being fired as a
  result of uBO redirecting resources is ``https://medium.com/`` (see dev
  console when loading a page from that site), where a CSP report is fired by
  the browser as a result of uBO redirecting Google Analytics script to uBO's
  neutered version.

  Polyfilled versions of Set/Map are provided for compatibility with pre-ES6
  browser versions. While at it, I also revisited some of the inner-most loops
  executed at load time to remove other observed overheads in profiling
  results.

| `Benchmarks

  that there are good gains to be had in performance and memory efficiency when
  using ES6 Set/Map. The performance gains are especially true when dealing
  with collections with a lot of *misses*, which is typical of the static and
  cosmetic filtering engines ni uBO.
|  
| Following the above refactoring, profiling Chromium/Firefox, I observed:

-  Non-selfie case: uBO will roughly load in about half the time, because:

   -  Using ES6 \`Set\` and \`Map\` instead of \`Object\`
   -  No longer using \`String.split\` to split lines into fields = less memory
      allocations = less work for garbage collector

-  Selfie-case: there is a marginal performance improvement at most in boot
   time -- make sense since a selfie is just a no-parsing-at-all load mechanism
   regardless of how the data is represented internally.

uBlock Origin 1.8.0 - August 2, 2016
------------------------------------

| **New**
|  
| New cosmetic filtering operators: ':has()', ':xpath()', ':style()'. See
  detailed documentation at `*"Static filter
  syntax"* <https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/3aaceb9b56b3c535b7f69aa9079c6088981adc527a4ecb22dd4a1c3b3c88c36e/https%3A//github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Static-filter-syntax>`__.
|  
| These new operators are to be used only for cosmetic filtering cases which
  are hard to crack -- more and more of these are surfacing (for example DOM
  elements with random class or id values).
|  
| When it comes to cosmetic filtering, preferably, always favor a plain old
  CSS3-based cosmetic filter, since they can be used in a declarative way,
  inside a 'style' tag. But there are cases where no CSS3-based expression will
  work, and in such case consider these new ':has' and ':xpath' operators.
|  
| Note that unlike ':has', ':xpath' is not a valid CSS4 expression, so they
  will always be enforced in a non-declarative way (in other word, javascript
  is doing the filtering, through
  `'document.evaluate' <https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/b5f98e52015e90142b865562bd75aa6c7bbeb0f62b710a14d508825c3ed8e9fa/https%3A//developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Document/evaluate>`__.
|  
| These new cosmetic filtering operators can be "excepted" like any other
  standard CSS3-based cosmetic filter using the usual '#@#' prompt. Such
  exception cosmetic filters do not have to be *specific* however, i.e. you do
  not have to associate them to a specific hostname/entity.
|  
| **Changes**
|  
| The content script code responsible to implement cosmetic filtering has been
  re-factored:
|  

-  To harden against sites which tries to work around uBO's cosmetic filtering.
-  To improve general performance and memory usage.
-  To support the new cosmetic filters.

|  
| **Changes:**
|  
| From now on, uBlock Origin will pull assets (filter lists, scriptlets) from a
  project dedicated strictly for the purpose of maintaining those resources:
  `uBlockOrigin/uAssets <https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/3d22d958a8bec9042d88dc1805c36e205ec65894a40dd89d9de011f7dd56d956/https%3A//github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets>`__.
  Notice that this project is owned by *uBlockOrigin*, an organization I
  created to maintain all things related to uBlock Origin, uMatrix. For now
  uAssets is the first project to be held under that organization.
|  
| The goal of
  `uBlockOrigin/uAssets <https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/3d22d958a8bec9042d88dc1805c36e205ec65894a40dd89d9de011f7dd56d956/https%3A//github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets>`__
  is to receive all the reports for the need of new filters, or reports of web
  pages broken by existing filters, and will be open for people to contribute
  (i.e. given write permissions on the project). Ideally I wish there will be
  eventually a small army of volunteers dedicated to deal with filter issues.

| **Changes:**
|  
| Changes:
|  
| Popup filters can also be used to filter popunders. This was the case in the
  original implementation of popunder filtering, however this was removed
  eventually as this was causing too many false positives for popunders,
  causing legitimate tabs to be closed (`issue
  1010 <https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/6fb67389a30fb28c4917bc390044dc0bed01affdf16f0174ac024f6cad3a95ce/https%3A//github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/1010>`__).
  The new solution is to still filter popunders according to existing popup
  filters, but to disregard popup filters which are too broad. Cases for which
  a popunder cannot be taken care by an existing popup filter, an explicit
  ``popunder`` filter should be used.

| **New:**
|  
| **Ability to set the default state of per-site switches (issue #1193)**
|  
| It is now possible to set the default value of `per-site
  switches <https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/d99754a2c1229381cc906a6e1c9b300db8e892488d2fef973f4ccc00294812ab/https%3A//github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Per-site-switches>`__
  from the *Settings* pane in the dashboard, under the *Default behavior*
  header. It was possible before to modify the default setting, but this had to
  be done by manually entering the proper rule in the *My rules* pane -- not
  very suitable to non-advanced users.
|  
| **Block media elements by size (issue #1163)**
|  
| There is a new per-site switch: `Block media elements by
  size <https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/116f1043b04bd600baa33816f6eab993d6a2d27e18f2039a329a21a5938159f0/https%3A//raw.githubusercontent.com/gorhill/uBlock/master/doc/img/popup-1h.png>`__

|  
| Primary purpose is to save bandwidth. See
  `documentation <https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/5ac26da66896178537f86259bba8a0b764b114ac506e3e2db00e34e2d990d3b9/https%3A//github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Per-site-switches%23no-large-media-elements>`__
  for more information.
|  
| Note that this feature has been implemented with the utmost care to not add
  overhead to those not using it. The content scripts to handle interaction
  with blocked media elements are injected *if and only if* large media
  elements were actually blocked.

|  
| **New:**
|  
| Ability to inject script resource from the resource library directly into a
  page -- i.e. not through redirection. Can be used to defeat some otherwise
  hard to defeat ad injection mechanisms on some sites. More specifically, this
  allows to defeat AdDefend- or Yavli-based ads on many sites (as of writing),
  which so far were defeated only through inline script tag filtering -- so
  this means that now Chromium-based browsers can also bypass AdDefend/Yavli
  (for example, see #1100). Some documentation available
  `here <https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/3c170b7e9db605765fff873a0ddb37fb3b006ea32e48bb53a8b7d4e048492a55/https%3A//github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Static-filter-syntax%23special-cosmetic-filters>`__

uBlock Origin 1.4.0 - December 12, 2015
---------------------------------------

| Summary of
  `changes <https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/0850dc1c26e912006ce84601c3c3b6c0c41d04ff1e09c4a5b9ec386da5939de1/https%3A//github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases/tag/1.4.0>`__:
|  
| **New:**
|  
| **Ability to use Adguard filter lists**
|  
| You can now directly use `Adguard filter
  lists <https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/60881d85810d6f41dc2ba50c4a8c42f96c84a0af7174cae9f274ab1c86c4c0c2/https%3A//adguard.com/en/filters.html>`__.
  Filters which use Adguard-specific filter syntax extension will simply be
  discarded by uBO.
|  
| **Popunders**
|  
| A new filter type is introduced: ``popunder``. This gives uBlock Origin the
  ability to block popunders. Popunders are when a web page opens a new
  legitimate content in another tab or window, while at the same time loading
  nuisance content in the current tab. They are essentially the reverse of what
  is happening with nuisance popups, where the nuisance content is opened in a
  new tab or window.
|  
| Since the ``popunder`` option is specific to uBO, any instance of sites using
  popunders will have to be reported on the `issue
  tracker <https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/f28cbb270490665ed7d7f7c6456df000c04ebb4afad1c36e3592f88fcd92225b/https%3A//github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues>`__
  so that filters can be crafted to address the issue for those sites.
|  
| **Redirection infrastructure**
|  
| Consider this still experimental. This adds the option to map blocked network
  requests to uBO-provided resources. Specifically, this solves issue raised in
  `#949 <https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/93bacae1bcbc2aee1e9d0572610b0669076d9a87f32c947c6aa074eec00dd30a/https%3A//github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/949>`__
  and
  `#1043 <https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/a757b9ef805781f50dc3751eafb5f3fb623ed1ea869d76cf494afd21ab59b3b6/https%3A//github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/1043>`__
  -- and more generally consider this yet another tool in uBO's arsenal to
  enforce users' choices.
|  
| The library of resources which are used for redirection is -- and will always
  be completely under control of uBO, this is not something under the control
  of any 3rd parties. This ensures only safe resources are used for
  redirection.
|  
| It could be said this feature is vaguely similar to `NoScript's
  surrogates <https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/21e0f1e9c6ab34d26e6e2a9a6a7f3a0803b6a40552dcbdd1ad23548403a6398e/https%3A//forums.informaction.com/viewforum.php%3Ff=26>`__,
  except that in the case of uBO it's network redirection to plainly map one
  resource into another one, and it can be used for any kind of resource, not
  just scripts (anything which can be represented with a ``data:`` URI).
|  
| Only blocked network requests are candidates for redirection.
|  
| To create a redirection filter, just add the ``redirect=[...]`` filter option
  to it, like so:
|  
| ``||example.com/badimage.*$image,redirect=2x2-transparent.png``
|  
| The ``[...]`` is a token identifying the resource to which to redirect: it
  must be a resource which appears in the `redirection
  library <https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/4c04370493329c7c1dc7030a3cc374740a7c53500c5fd0cba6bd02ea099c8f4c/https%3A//github.com/gorhill/uBlock/blob/master/assets/ublock/redirect-resources.txt>`__.
|  
| For the ``redirect=`` filter option to be taken into account, some conditions
  must be met by the static filter, for efficiency purpose. The static filter
  ...
|  

-  must be hostname-anchored, i.e. starts with ``||``.
-  must have one type specified -- negated types are not valid.
-  must have a redirect token which identifies an existing resource in the
   redirection library.

| 
| If at least one of the above conditions is not met, no redirection will take
  place, though the filter will still block matching network requests.
