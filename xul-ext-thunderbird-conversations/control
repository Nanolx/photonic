Description: Google Mail-like threaded conversations for Thunderbird
 This extension improves the threaded summary for emails in Thunderbird 3.0+.
 It vastly improves the UI by including some ideas from GMail. More specifically:
 .
    * your own messages are displayed in the thread
    * you initially see summaries, they can be expanded to display full messages
    * quoted sections are collapsed Ã  la GMail
    * fast links for replying (and possibly other useful actions),
    * you can reply inline (through a "quick reply" feature)
    * integration with Icedove Contacts
