  * New upstream release

      - Added: Framescripts to access DOM content
      - Changed: Files and folders are created using OS.File.jsm and FileUtils.jsm
        functions
      - Changed: moved checking for cache files into separate for loop because
        continueImageSave was being called multiple times and also being called
        even if cancelled prompt dialog
      - Fixed: some tabs were being closed if a previous save had set the SI_canClose
        attribute but the tab was not closed

    v1.2.2
