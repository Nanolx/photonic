xul-ext-ublock-origin (1.5.3-1nano) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Changes:
    - uBO will now automatically select the filter list which matches the current
      browser locale at first install time. This change does nothing if you have
      uBO already installed
  * Closed as fixed:
  * Core:
    - Show number of popups blocked
    - The script tag filters ignore the whitelist
    - Titlebar should have a settings icon
    - Why not add by default the ad list of the locale of the browser?

xul-ext-ublock-origin (1.5.1-1nano) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Closed as fixed:
  * Core:
    + Domain option is ignored (regression bug).
      + Survey shows 137 filters were affected in EasyList+EasyPrivacy combined:
        Filters with a `domain=` option with one single negated hostname were
        affected.
    + Entity-based script injection cosmetic filters not working.

xul-ext-ublock-origin (1.5.0-1nano) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * New:
    + Ability to inject script resource from the resource library directly into a
      page -- i.e. not through redirection. Can be used to defeat some otherwise
      hard to defeat ad injection mechanisms on some sites. More specifically,
      this allows to defeat AdDefend- or Yavli-based ads on many sites (as of
      writing), which so far were defeated only through inline script tag filtering
      -- so this means that now Chromium-based browsers can also bypass AdDefend/Yavli
      (for example, see #1100). Some documentation available here (will eventually
      create a dedicated page).
    + Enabling advanced user mode won't cause the tooltips to be disabled anymore.
      There is now a separate setting for tooltips in the Settings pane: "Disable
      tooltips". Tooltips are enabled by default.
  * Issues Closed as fixed:
  * Core:
    + [Logger] Cannot reverse find a specific filter
    + On a site with 0 connections displayed
    + [Efficiency] Make use of String.prototype.startsWith
    + no-popups: * true rule blocks opening of a clicked url
    + [static filter syntax] separator characters (^) support
    + Use case: does an advanced user still need tooltips?

xul-ext-ublock-origin (1.4.0-1nano) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * New:
    + Ability to use Adguard filter lists
      You can now directly use Adguard filter lists. Filters which use Adguard-
      specific filter syntax extension will simply be discarded by uBO.
    + Popunders
      A new filter type is introduced: popunder. This gives uBlock Origin the
      ability to block popunders. Popunders are when a web page opens a new
      legitimate content in another tab or window, while at the same time loading
      nuisance content in the current tab. They are essentially the reverse of what
      is happening with nuisance popups, where the nuisance content is opened in
      a new tab or window.
      .
      Since the popunder option is specific to uBO, any instance of sites using
      popunders will have to be reported on the issue tracker so that filters
      can be crafted to address the issue for those sites.
    + Redirection infrastructure
      Consider this still experimental. This adds the option to map blocked network
      requests to uBO-provided resources. Specifically, this solves issue raised
      in #949 and #1043 -- and more generally consider this yet another tool in
      uBO's arsenal to enforce users' choices.
      .
      The library of resources which are used for redirection is -- and will
      always be completely under control of uBO, this is not something under the
      control of any 3rd parties. This ensures only safe resources are used for
      redirection.
      .
      It could be said this feature is vaguely similar to NoScript's surrogates,
      except that in the case of uBO it's network redirection to plainly map one
      resource into another one, and it can be used for any kind of resource, not
      just scripts (anything which can be represented with a data: URI).
      .
      Only blocked network requests are candidates for redirection.
      .
      To create a redirection filter, just add the redirect=[...] filter option
      to it, like so:
      .
        ||example.com/badimage.*$image,redirect=2x2-transparent.png
      .
      The [...] is a token identifying the resource to which to redirect: it must
      be a resource which appears in the redirection library.
      .
      For the redirect= filter option to be taken into account, some conditions
      must be met by the static filter, for efficiency purpose. The static filter ...
      .
      must be hostname-anchored, i.e. starts with ||.
      must have one type specified -- negated types are not valid.
      must have a redirect token which identifies an existing resource in the
        redirection library.
      .
      If at least one of the above conditions is not met, no redirection will
      take place, though the filter will still block matching network requests.

      [Firefox] Inline script tag filtering incompatible with Firefox ESR 38.
      [Firefox] Mouse context menu broken.
      [Firefox] WebRTC and FF 42.0. With Firefox 42+, it is now possible to prevent
                local IP address leakage without entirely disabling WebRTC.
      [Firefox] Cosmetic filters not always reported by logger on Firefox 42 if
                you refresh the page.
      [Firefox for Android] uBlock Origin 1.1.1 broken in FF-nightly until I
                            disable/enable. Thanks to @AlexVallat for having
                            investigated the root cause of the issue.

      [Pale Moon] 1.3.4 removed all settings & built in 3rd party filters. This
                  probably also affected older versions of Firefox.
    1.3.6
      [Firefox for Android] uBlock Origin 1.3.4 (and next) broken in Firefox for
                            Android Release (42.0.1) until I disable/enable.
                            Timing issue, so not necessarily everybody was affected
                            by the bug.
