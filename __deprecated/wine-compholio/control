Description: The Compholio Edition is a special build of the popular Wine software
 with patches representing my current staging tree for Wine.
 Currently these patches fix:
  * Netflix on Firefox hangs with loading bar at 100% (Bug 31993).
  * Netflix on Firefox fails with Internet Connection Problem when loading bar is
 at 99% (Bug 31858).

 Microsoft Windows Compatibility Layer (Binary Emulator and Library)
 Wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows applications on Linux.
 Applications are run at full speed without the need of cpu emulation. Wine
 does not require Microsoft Windows, however it can use native system dll
 files in place of its own if they are available.
 .
 This package includes a program loader for running unmodified Windows executables
 as well as the Wine project's free version of the Windows API for running programs
 ported from Windows.
 .
 This package is based on a recent Wine beta.  While many more applications will
 work, there may be some loss of functionality compared with the stable release
 provided by the regular wine package.
