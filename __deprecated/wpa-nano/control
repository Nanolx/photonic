Description: user space IEEE 802.11 AP and IEEE 802.1X/WPA/WPA2/EAP Authenticator
 Originally, hostapd was an optional user space component for Host AP
 driver. It adds more features to the basic IEEE 802.11 management
 included in the kernel driver: using external RADIUS authentication
 server for MAC address based access control, IEEE 802.1X Authenticator
 and dynamic WEP keying, RADIUS accounting, WPA/WPA2 (IEEE 802.11i/RSN)
 Authenticator and dynamic TKIP/CCMP keying.
 .
 The current version includes support for other drivers, an integrated
 EAP authenticator (i.e., allow full authentication without requiring
 an external RADIUS authentication server), and RADIUS authentication
 server for EAP authentication.
 .
 hostapd works with the following drivers:
 .
  * mac80211 based drivers with support for master mode [linux]
  * Host AP driver for Prism2/2.5/3 [linux]
  * Any wired Ethernet driver for wired IEEE 802.1X authentication.

Description: client support for WPA and WPA2 (IEEE 802.11i)
 WPA and WPA2 are methods for securing wireless networks, the former
 using IEEE 802.1X, and the latter using IEEE 802.11i. This software
 provides key negotiation with the WPA Authenticator, and controls
 association with IEEE 802.11i networks.
