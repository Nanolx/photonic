Description: Input device setup application
 Touch√© is an application that brings full support on GNU/Linux desktops
 to your input devices: keyboard, mices, even IR remote receivers.
 .
 It uses the special kernel device "hiddev", so if your input device does
 send events there, you have good chance of having it supported!
