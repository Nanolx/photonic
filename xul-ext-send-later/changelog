  * New upstream release
    - BUG: Scheduling messages with monthly recurrence was broken and has been fixed.
    - BUG: Fix incompatibility with Thunderbird versions before 17.
    - BUG: Fix incompatibility with Seamonkey versions newer than 2.41a1.
    - BUG: Fix the pop-up menu in the main Thunderbird window so it only pops up
      when you click on the Thunderbird part of the status bar, rather than when
      you click anywhere in the status bar.
    - ENHANCEMENT: When there are no dynamic scheduling functions defined, i.e.,
      before the first time the user has opened the dynamic function editor,
      desensitize the dynamic function selector in the Send Later prompt window,
      since there are no dynamic functions to select.
    - ENHANCEMENT: Fix the height of the dynamic function pop-up menu in the Send
      Later prompt window so that it is correctly full height, rather than being
      very short until the user selects a function.
    - I18N: Translation updates.

xul-ext-send-later (5.1-1nano) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Send Later is now fully compatible with Enigmail! Many thanks to Patrick
      Brunschwig from the Enigmail development team for working with me to make
      this possible.
    - Thunderbird now pops up the spell-check-before-send window (if it is enabled)
      and checks messages for empty Subject lines when they are scheduled using
      buttons or input fields on the compose window toolbar. Previously, neither
      spell-checking nor the empty-subject check would happen in this context
      (i.e., this was a bug, and it is now fixed).
    - The "Send Now" button in the Send Later dialog now pops up a dialog when
      it is used, to ensure that users don't click it when they actually meant
      to click the scheduled send button. There is a checkbox in this dialog to
      allow it to be suppressed in the future.
    - In a further effort to reduce confusion about the "Put In Outbox" and
      "Send Now" buttons in the Send Later dialog, the "Put In Outbox" button
      is now only visible when the dialog is popped up using "File | Send Later"
      or Ctrl-Shift-Enter, and the "Send Now" button is now only visible when the
      "'Send' Does 'Send Later'" preference is enabled and the dialog is popped
      up using "File | Send Now" or Ctrl-Enter.
    - This release includes many translation updates. Thanks, as always, to my
      wonderful team of translators!
    - This release increases compatibility settings for newer Thunderbird and
      Seamonkey releases.
    - As a side benefit of the other work enumerated above, a good chunk of the
      add-on's code has been cleaned up and refactored.

xul-ext-send-later (5.0.1-1nano) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Fixed a couple of bugs in the time-of-day restriction functionality
      introduced in release 5.0. 

 -- Christopher Roy Bratusek <nano@jpberlin.de>  Tue, 07 Jun 2016 19:08:22 +0200

xul-ext-send-later (5.0-1nano) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * New features:
    - Messages can now be scheduled to send on a minutely basis, i.e., every minute,
      or every 2 minutes, or every 3 minutes, etc. Delivery of recurring messages
      can now be restricted by time of day and day of week. This restriction is
      enforced on the message's initial scheduled delivery time and in each
      subsequently scheduled recurring delivery. Furthermore, there is a preference
      you can enable to enforce it on late message delivery as well. In other words,
      if Thunderbird isn't running when at the scheduled delivery time, and when
      you launch Thunderbird the current time conflicts with the delivery restrictions,
      then by default the message will be delivered despite the conflict, but if
      you enable the preference, then delivery will be delayed until the delivery
      restrictions are satisfied.
    - There is a new preference you can enable to prevent Send Later from delivering
      messages late, e.g., because Thunderbird wasn't running at the scheduled
      delivery time. When this preference is enabled, Send Later will pop up a
      warning about the late message instead of delivering it.
  * Bug fixes:
    - The shortcut buttons in the compose window toolbar are now disabled when a
      previously scheduled message with recurrence is edited. In this context,
      the user should open the Send Later dialog to reschedule the message, rather
      than using shortcut buttons.
    - The "week of the month" checkbox (e.g., "1st Saturday of the month", "3rd
      Tuesday of the month") in the scheduling dialog is now disabled correctly
      when the user clears the scheduled send time or switches to a recurrence
      frequency other than monthly.

xul-ext-send-later (4.4.5-1nano) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Disable scheduling messages when Enigmail is active
    Unfortunately, limitations in the Thunderbird add-on framework make it
    somewhere between difficult and impossible to make scheduled messages with
    Send Later work safely and properly when the Enigmail add-on is installed
    and enabled.

xul-ext-send-later (4.4.4-1nano) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  - Bug: Fix Send Later column after using quick filter
    Previously, if you used the quick filter bar to search messages in the Drafts
    folder, then the Send Later column would stop working. This is fixed.
  - Bug: Fix incompatibility with the Mnenhy add-on
    Recent necessary changes made Send Later incompatible with the Mnenhy add-on,
    because Mnenhy replaces certain core Thunderbird components. Send Later now
    has a workaround for this problem.

xul-ext-send-later (4.4.4~beta2-1nano) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  - Work around problems caused by Mnenhy add-on:
    .
    The Mnenhy add-on replaces the Thunderbird header display pane with one of
    its own, which causes Send Later -- which overlays its functionality on top
    of the standard Thunderbird header display pane -- to malfunction. This, in
    turn, causes Mnenhy to malfunction, thereby causing problems with message
    display.
    .
    This change mitigates this problem by suppressing the exceptions within Send
    Later caused by Mnenhy's UI changes. The Send Later functionality for
    automatically hiding or displaying the x-send-later-at header as needed still
    doesn't work with Mnenhy, but at least everything else should work after this
    change.

xul-ext-send-later (4.4.4~beta1-1nano) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    4.4.2~beta1
      - The add-on name which shows up in the status bar at the bottom of
        the main window has been changed from "Send Later 3" to "Send Later".
      - A bug which caused displayed message headers sometimes to be
        aligned incorrectly has been fixed.
      - There is now a Brazilian Portuguese translation, thanks to "wetabax"
    4.4.2~beta2
      - Bug fix: The previous beta released introduce a bug which caused
        the wrong message's header to display about the messages after
        opening a message in its own tab and then moving to a different
        message in that tab. 
    4.4.2~beta3
      - Bug fix: When the prompt window comes up, the "Every" checkbox
        shouldn't be displayed until a send time has been entered and a
        recurrence other than "none" has been specified.
      - Maintenance: Upgrade to SugarJS 1.4.1, which should be mostly
        transparent to users but may improve locale support.
    4.4.2~beta4
      - Bug fix: Prior to this fix, if the user ran Thunderbird when the
        system clock was incorrectly set in the future, and then subsequently
        the system clock was fixed, Send Later would stop delivering
        scheduled messages until the current time "caught up" to the
        previous, future time.
      - Make some non-functional changes to appease the
        addons.mozilla.org add-on validator.
    4.4.3
      - Bug fix: If the user runs Thunderbird when the system clock is
        incorrectly set in the future, and then subsequently the system
        clock is fixed, Send Later would stop delivering scheduled messages.
    4.4.4~beta1
      - Bug fix: Previously, if you used the quick filter bar to search
        the messages in the Drafts folder, then the Send Later column
        would stop working.

xul-ext-send-later (4.4.1-1nano) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bugfix release
     Compatibility fix for Thunderbird 37+.

xul-ext-send-later (4.4-1nano) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    All the shortcut keys in the Send Later prompt window mentioned in
    the user guide now work in Mac OS, using the Mac OS command key as
    for other standard Mac OS shortcut keys.

    On other platforms (e.g., Windows, Linux), the key for activating
    shortcuts has changed from Alt to Ctrl.

    The Ctrl key is what we should have been using all along, but we
    were using Alt instead for historical reasons. In order to make
    shortcuts work on Mac OS, we need to standardize on the "correct"
    shortcut key on all platforms, hence the change on the other platforms.

xul-ext-send-later (4.3.1-1nano) unstable; urgency=low

  * new upstream bugfix release
    4.3.0
      * Scheduled messages are no longer sent repeatedly when the Drafts
        folder is corrupted. Instead, when Send Later encounters a message
        in the Drafts folder that it has already sent, it displays an error
        notifying the user that the Drafts folder needs to be repaired.
      * The X-Enigmail-Draft-Status header is now removed from scheduled
        messages before they are sent by Send Later.
      * Compatibility with Thunderbird 26+ and Seamonkey 2.23+.
      * Some debug log messages generated by Send Later have been downgraded
        in priority to make them easier for folks who care about such things
        to ignore them.
      * Send Later now warns you on exit if you have pending messages
        scheduled to be sent, to help you avoid accidentally quitting
        when you meant to leave the application running so it could send
        the messages. There is a checkbox in the message you can uncheck
        if you don't want to be warned again.
      * It is once again possible to use local mailing lists in scheduled
        messages. This functionality was broken by a recent Thunderbird release
        but is now fixed.
      * Translation updates. Thank you as always to my translators, including
        new translator Kari Eveli!
      * More robust performance in foreign languages.
    4.3.1
      * Fix the accelerator keys for the shortcut buttons, i.e., you can
        now type Alt-1, Alt-2, or Alt-3 in the Send Later dialog to activate
        the first, second, or third shortcut button. This has been broken
        for over two years, but no one reported the problem until recently!
      * Update the Japanese translation. Thanks, as always, to my awesome translators!
      * Eliminate some unnecessary error log messages showing up in the error console.
