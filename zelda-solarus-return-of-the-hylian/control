Description: Zelda Fangame using Solarus engine
 Zelda Return of the Hylian Solarus Edition is a
 "The Legend Of Zelda - A Link To The Past"-like Fangame using
 the Solarus OpenSource game engine.
 .
 After Link's victory over Ganon (in "A Link to the Past"),
 no one knows what Link's wish to the Triforce was. But this
 wish reunified the Light World and the Dark World and brought
 the 7 wise men's descendants back to life. Peace was back in
 Hyrule. But unfortunately, this wish also ressurected Ganon
 and his henchmen. He was preparing his revenge, but he couldn't
 do anything without the Triforce. One night, a familiar voice
 speaks to Link in his sleepâ€¦
