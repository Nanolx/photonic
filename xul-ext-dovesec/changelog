xul-ext-dovesec (2.0-1nano) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - ThunderSec now supports Spam URI Realtime Blackhole Lists (SURBL). With
      this enhancement, message bodies are also inspected in addition to message
      headers and links included in the message body are tested against SURBL
      services (Issue #22).
    - Optionally displays a notification bar when no security violations are
      found. This functionality is enabled by default but can be adjusted from
      Preferences (Issue #19).
